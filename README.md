# Programmer Buddy - Chrome Extension
<sub>A smart Socratic tutor to help you think, not just code.</sub>

Programmer Buddy is a Chrome extension designed for students and self-learners tackling programming problems on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef. Instead of giving you the answer, Buddy acts as a Socratic guide, asking leading questions and providing step-by-step hints to help you arrive at the solution on your own.
It's the perfect companion to build problem-solving skills, overcome mental blocks, and foster a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.
Install on Chrome Web Store <!-- TODO: Add link when published -->
## ‚ú® Features
### Socratic Learning:
  Get guiding questions and conceptual hints, never the direct solution.
### Seamless Integration: 
  Automatically appears on popular coding problem websites.
### Interactive Chat: 
Have a real-time conversation with your AI-powered buddy.
### Context-Aware: 
Buddy reads the problem description to provide relevant, high-quality guidance.
### Lightweight & Minimalist: 
A clean, unobtrusive UI that doesn't get in your way.
## üöÄ How It Works
Programmer Buddy is a powerful combination of a browser extension frontend and an AI-powered backend.
#### Content Script (extension/):
  When you navigate to a supported problem page, a JavaScript content script activates. It carefully scrapes the problem description from the page and injects the "Buddy" chat interface into the DOM.
#### API Request: 
  Your interactions in the chat window, along with the problem context, are sent to a dedicated backend API.
#### FastAPI Backend (backend/): 
  A lightweight Python backend built with FastAPI receives the request.
#### The AI Brain (Google Gemini): 
  The backend uses a meticulously crafted system prompt to instruct Google's Gemini Pro model. This prompt commands the AI to act as a Socratic tutor, forbidding it from ever revealing the final answer.
### Helpful Hint: 
  The AI-generated hint is sent back to the browser and displayed in the chat window, continuing the learning conversation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
### Frontend: 
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
### Backend: 
  Python, FastAPI
### AI: Google Gemini API


# üîß Local Development & Testing

Want to run the project locally to test, contribute, or see how it works under the hood? You'll need to run both the backend server and the frontend extension.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.11+

Google Chrome

A Google Gemini API Key (you can get a free one from Google AI Studio)

## Part 1: Backend Setup (The AI Brain)

First, let's get the local server running.

### Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/programmer-buddy.git
    cd programmer-buddy/backend


Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
This keeps the project's dependencies isolated.

# Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

### Activate it
#### On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
#### On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

#### Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment active, run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Set Up Your API Key

Create a new file in the backend directory named .env.

Open this .env file and add your Google Gemini API key like so:

GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...YourSecretKeyHere..."

Run the Server!
Now, start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend is now live at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Leave this terminal window running.

## Part 2: Frontend Setup (The Chrome Extension)

Now, let's connect the Chrome extension to your local server.

Configure the Endpoint

In a code editor, open the file extension/content.js.

Find the fetch call inside the getHintFromBackend function and ensure the URL points to your local server.

// extension/content.js

const response = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8000/get-hint", {
    // ...
});

Load the Extension in Chrome

Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.

Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner.

Click the "Load unpacked" button.

In the file browser that appears, select the extension folder from this project.

‚úÖ All Done! The "Programmer Buddy" extension is now installed and connected to your local backend. Navigate to a supported website like LeetCode to see it in action
